# Hi there 👋, I’m Gokul

I’m a software & data engineer with over two years of experience building full stack, backend systems, data infrastructure, cloud platforms, and automation driven solutions. My work spans data pipelines, APIs, analytics systems, and AI assisted automation for Saas, Hospitality and Education Industries.

## Expertise

Over the past couple of years, I’ve worked on building software systems that automate workflows and power data driven applications in real world environments. A consistent part of my work has been designing systems that sit between data, external APIs, and downstream users, making sure information flows reliably from source to product.

I’ve spent a significant amount of time building backend services and integration layers that support analytics, reporting, and operational tooling. This included developing APIs, orchestrating data pipelines, and improving system performance, with a strong focus on reducing latency, handling failures gracefully, and making systems observable in production.

Alongside this, I’ve built automation driven reporting and analytics workflows that replace manual processes with reliable, self updating systems. By integrating third party services with internal datasets and standardizing data models and metrics, I’ve helped teams move away from ad hoc reporting toward platforms they can trust day to day, while reducing operational overhead.
