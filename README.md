## About

I design and build **data-intensive systems** – from full stack apps and backend APIs to ETL/ELT pipelines and cloud data platforms – that support analytics, reporting, and product features.

I work across **Software Engineering**, **Data/Analytics Engineering**, and **Cloud Engineering**, with a focus on reliability, performance, and clear, decision ready data.

## What I Work On

- Data pipelines and ELT workflows (batch + scheduled)  
- Backend and data services for analytics and reporting  
- Full stack, data driven features (React + Node.js APIs)  
- Cloud lakehouse/warehouse setups and KPI layers
