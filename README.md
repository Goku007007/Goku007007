## About

**Data Analytics Engineer** targeting Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer / BI Engineer / Data Analyst roles in the US (Remote/Hybrid; open to relocate).

**Core stack:** SQL Â· Python Â· dbt Â· Airflow Â· Snowflake/Redshift Â· Databricks Â· Power BI Â· Tableau Â· AWS Â· Azure Â· APIs Â· Git Â· CI/CD.

**Impact:** Designed event-driven ETL/ELT pipelines and standardized models that cut refresh times by **85%+** and power leadership decisions for public-sector and SaaS teams.  
I like **dimensional modeling**, **cost-aware design**, and **crisp storytelling** with data.
