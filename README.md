## About

Data Analytics Engineer targeting Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer / BI Engineer / Data Analyst roles in the US (Remote/Hybrid; open to relocate).

**Core stack:** SQL · Python · dbt · Airflow · Snowflake/Redshift · Databricks · Power BI · Tableau · AWS · Azure · APIs · Git · CI/CD.

**Impact:** Designed event-driven ETL/ELT pipelines and standardized models that cut refresh times by **85%+** and power leadership decisions for public-sector and SaaS teams.  
I like **dimensional modeling**, **cost-aware design**, and **crisp storytelling** with data.

## Highlights

- Reduced weekly civic, student, and wellness data preparation time from 6 hours to 2 hours by engineering automated ETL pipelines in Airflow with dbt models on Snowflake.
- Unified more than 5 TB of open data from BigQuery and Snowflake into a single lakehouse, enabling real-time cross-domain analytics for transit and city operations.
- Reduced CRM data latency from 2 hours to 15 minutes for over 10,000 users using PySpark pipelines orchestrated with Airflow.
- Improved query performance by 35 percent and reduced compute costs by 15 percent on Redshift and Databricks via SQL and cluster tuning.
- Standardized executive reporting by defining core KPIs in Snowflake and surfacing them through Tableau and Power BI.

## Selected Projects

### National EV Charging Infrastructure Analytics
A data engineering and analytics project focused on public EV charging infrastructure across the United States.

- Ingested more than 80,000 charging station records into cloud storage and BigQuery, separating raw and curated layers.
- Modeled coverage, uptime, and port availability to evaluate network reliability by state and network provider.
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard that surfaces coverage gaps, network leaderboards, and expansion opportunities.

### GPU Cluster Telemetry and Observability System
An observability lakehouse for GPU cluster telemetry and cost insights.

- Ingested over 10 million trace rows into a Parquet and DuckDB backend following a Bronze, Silver, and Gold layering strategy.
- Standardized raw JSON logs into queryable tables for utilization, saturation, and error analysis.
- Enabled low-latency queries and daily cost analysis to understand GPU usage patterns and anomalies.

### Additional Work
I also build smaller tools and experiments around:

- Data quality monitoring and alerting  
- Self service analytics layers for non-engineering stakeholders  
- Simple web services and internal tools using FastAPI and modern front-end frameworks  

You can find more in the pinned repositories on this profile.

## How I Work

- Design from the warehouse and serving layer backwards, so that models and pipelines are aligned with actual decision-making needs.
- Use AI tools for exploration, scaffolding, and large codebase edits, but keep tests, observability, and production reviews as non-negotiable safeguards.
- Prefer simple, well-documented solutions over clever ones that are hard to maintain.
- Track cost and performance from the beginning instead of treating them as afterthoughts.
